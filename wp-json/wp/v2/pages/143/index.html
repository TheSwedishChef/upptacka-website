My primary concerns are <em>creating the depth of character for an actor to play with<\/em> and <em>the aesthetics of the cinematic\/iconic.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong>A brief history<\/strong>\r\nI started mentoring in 2001, after a student at my church was told that \u2018her faith was inappropriate for a student at their college\u2019. After talking at a meeting at the college in question, I found that there were others who had suffered the same kind of abuse. Whilst thinking I could limit myself to cerebral, even spiritual things on her behalf, I decided that personal commitment was needed. A monthly meeting was set up to provide encouragement and cultural critique, as well as giving the artists a space to talk about their work and have an \u2018open critique\u2019.\r\n\r\nOver the years The Group has grown to over 60 artists around Bristol and the South West. The original focus on visual artists has expanded to include word, image and performance arts. In 2007, we put on an exhibition entitled \u2018Set All Free\u2019 at our local gallery \u2013 Grant Bradley \u2013 which included painting, sculpture, installation (including video), ceramics, photography and poetry. We had a gospel choir for the Preview, which had an impact on the proprietors; the place packed out for a wonderful show.\r\n\r\nBetween 2007 and 2009, \u2018The Tree House\u2019, a monthly caf\u00e9 event, gave space for dance, fashion producers showing their work, film, performance poetry, cultural critique, a philosopher\u2019s corner and talks on visual art, plus live music. We met for 2 years in Saint Stephens Caf\u00e9, in the Heart o\u2019 the City of Bristol!\r\n\r\nIn the late 80\u2019s we moved to Bristol to effect a change of direction. I studied at Bristol Polytechnic and majored in Art History. My dissertation was on the \u2018Iconoclastic Disorders of the 16th Century\u2019. In the 90\u2019s whilst holding down a job as a photographic curator, I studied for a research degree at the University of Exeter, for which I received an MPhil.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m inspired by people like Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was part of the resistance to the Nazi Regime in Germany and also Jacques Ellul a writer of great insight and spirituality and a member of the French Resistance.\r\n\r\nSo, this is me. Part writer, part mentor. I\u2019ve a heart for people and \u2018things\u2019, the \u2018things\u2019 which Jesus concerns Himself about, everyday life, everyday creativity, as well as everyday people. In the Postmodern landscape of fractured lives and fractured things, we need to walk together, not stand alone.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/upptacka.com\/publications\/the-wilderness-and-the-desert-of-the-real\">The Wilderness and the Desert of the Real<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/upptacka.com\/publications\/the-cultural-way-of-being\">The Cultural Way of Being<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/artsmentoring.co\">Arts Mentoring website<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/artsmentoringco\">follow @ArtsMentoringCo on Twitter<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Chris Lorensson<\/h3>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/upptacka.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/portrait-chris-lorensson.jpg\" alt=\"a black and white portrait of author Chris Lorensson\" title=\"a black and white portrait of author Chris Lorensson\" width=\"200\" height=\"206\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-145\" \/>I was born 19<sup>th<\/sup> October 1981 in Corona, California. Growing up in Orange County and Los Angeles, I studied English Literature in advanced placement before dropping out of high school in my senior year. I started writing poetry at 15\u2014feeling a sense of freedom in poetry which has never left me. In my late teens and early twenties I was deeply steeped in music and percussion for punk-rock groups and hip-hop.\r\n\r\nMy love for English Literature and my history in hip-hop lyricism naturally merged in my poetry, and it felt right, so I pursued that route, but my punk-rock sensibilities still seep through. I concerned myself, spiritually, with issues of community and social justice throughout my life, and it showed through in the projects I had undertaken. In 2000, I started the international arts collaboration <em>M4TH<\/em>, putting on art shows and fostering a communal feel through the art. I was working as a Chief Designer at a record label in LA then. In 2001, through my love for hip-hop, I met Shiloh Bradshaw who now runs Springfield Pulse and <a href=\"http:\/\/phoenixartsproject.org\">The Phoenix Arts Project<\/a> in Springfield MA. Shiloh and I started Pulse in Downtown Fullerton. It was a collaboration of post-modern Christian artists. Alongside Shiloh, I helped organise slam-poetry events in Downtown Fullerton, and sometimes I performed my work, which quickly led me to realise my poetry was different- not traditional slam poetry (even though it was somewhat rooted in hip-hop), but more mixed with the anarchist tendencies from my past, and refined by my exposure to proper English Literature.\r\n\r\nI moved to Bristol UK in 2005, where I have continued in graphic design as a career, and helped develop what is now quite a significant communal social-action project, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovebristol.org\">LoveBristol<\/a>. My past experience of alternative communities coupled with my current experience of LoveBristol has lead me to write a book on <em>individuality and identity in faith communities<\/em>, called <em>Mirror<\/em>, which will probably be completed in 2011 and published in 2012.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/newundergroundpoetry.com\">New Underground Poetry<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/chrislorensson\">follow @ChrisLorensson on Twitter<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>","_et_gb_content_width":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Authors - Uppt\u00e4cka Press<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/upptacka.com\/authors\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Authors - Uppt\u00e4cka Press\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Geoff Hall Bristol, UK What inspires me to write are matters of human rights and social justice.
